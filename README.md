# Brute Force LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my repository! This is a personal collection of brute force solutions to various problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). The main purpose of this repo is to:

- Track my progress as I practice problem-solving.
- Serve as a reference for basic, straightforward approaches to common algorithmic challenges.
- Help others understand the most naive or initial ways to tackle LeetCode problems before optimizing.

## About

All solutions stored here are intentionally **brute force**. They are not optimized for efficiency, but rather focus on clarity and fundamental logic. These solutions are often the first step before moving on to more advanced or optimized methods.

**Note:** Brute force solutions may not pass all LeetCode test cases within time limits, but they are intended as learning tools.

## Repository Structure

- Each problem is organized by its LeetCode number and title (if possible).
- Solutions are written in `<your_preferred_language>` (update this section as needed).
- Example folder structure:
  ```
  /problems/
    001-two-sum.py
    002-add-two-numbers.py
    ...
  ```

## Usage

Feel free to browse, fork, or use these brute force solutions for:

- Learning basic algorithmic thinking.
- Reference for your own solution attempts.
- Understanding the trade-offs between brute force and optimized approaches.

## Contributing

This repository is primarily for my own learning, but if you'd like to contribute more brute force solutions or suggest improvements, feel free to make a pull request!

## Disclaimer

These solutions are for educational purposes only. Always try to come up with your own solutions first before referring to this repository.
